		- fixed inCheck(), will not check for king in board indicies out of bounds.

10/25 Josh 4:13PM:
	- Added king moveset;
		* can only move 1 space fwd/bwd/side/diag
		* cannot move to space where it can be captured (check)
		* cannot move to a space occupied by teammate
		* castling (can move 2 spaces iff):
			> king and rook involved has never moved
			> king isn't skipping *checkable* space
			> king isn't currently in check
			> king isn't skipping pieces
			> king does not end up in check
		* castling moves the rook "behind" king

10/25 Josh 8:26PM:
	ChessHelper:
		- Added checkmate; canUncheck(): method used to determine if a team can escape check.
